This project is part of an assignment for the Coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data.
this project demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

This project utilizes data concerning Human Activity Recognition(har) while using smartphone data. 
The data used was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
The subjects were a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each subject performed six activities 
(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on their waist. 
Using the smartphone's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the researchers captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity 
data at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments were video-recorded to label the data manually. 
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers 
were selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The data was obtained from the University of California at Irvine. 

The following files( to include this readme) are part of this deliverable for this assignment.
1.  run_analysis.R script - This script contains the code used, as well as the steps involved to create
a tidy data set with contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
2.  A tidy data output file saved as a text file called hardata.txt. 
3.  A codebook describing the data used for this project. harcodebook.txt
